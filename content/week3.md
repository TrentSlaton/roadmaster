## Straight Line Backing

1. make sure mirrors are properly adjusted to you (sides of trailer should be just visible on the edge of your mirrors)
1. drive truck straight forward so that it is centered in your lane. use your mirrors to judge this
1. with your steer axel and steering wheel straight, place your right hand at 12 o'clock on the steering wheel and your left arm on the window sill
1. put the truck in reverse and take feet off both pedals. do not use your brake... just put your foot on the floor board
1. keep your eyes on your mirrors at all times. use the driver side mirror 90% of the time. just glance at the passenger side mirror if needed
1. either keep your wheel straight, or use the "wiggle" technique of alternating between 11 and 1 o'clock on the steering wheel
1. when your trailer starts to drift, turn the wheel *no more than 9 to 3 o'clock* ***towards*** the problem

* when driving forward, drive the *truck*. when driving backward, drive the *trailer*
* *when putting the rear bumper in the box, use your trailer's marker light as a reference... remember to Get Out And Look... you do **not** want to put the bumper past the box!!*

## Offset Backing

1. make sure mirrors are properly adjusted to you (sides of trailer should be just visible on the edge of your mirrors)
1. drive truck straight forward so that it is centered in your lane. use your mirrors to judge this
1. with your steer axel and steering wheel straight, place your right hand at 12 o'clock on the steering wheel and your left arm on the window sill
1. put the truck in reverse and take feet off both pedals. do not use your brake... just put your foot on the floor board
1. turn the wheel 12 to 12 in the *opposite* direction that you want the trailer to go (if your trailer needs to left, turn to the right and vice versa)
1. use your convex mirror to split the center cone with the vertical part of the rear bumper
1. turn your wheel all the way the other way to get under your trailer
1. observe the two entry cones in your mirrors. you should be centered between them
    * to make an adjustment, turn your wheel all the way *towards* the problem to create some space, then turn your wheel all the way the other way to get under your trailer. if done properly, you should now be centered between the two entry cones

## Forward Offset Tracking

* Setup
    1. straight line all the way back
    1. forward stop
            * use the cone in the windshield or the driver's side hood mirror and the yellow line to judge where to stop. mirror is better since not all the cones are the same height
    1. pull forward till all the way outside the box
    1. straight line back til just outside the box
* Begin maneuver
    1. pull forward until trailer multi-purpose light is in line with the forwardmost cone
    1. 12 to 12 to 6 to the left (1 and a half turns of the wheel)
        * outer tire of the front driver side tandems are on the dashed line
    1. turn the wheel all the way to the right until under trailer
    1. straight forward
        * inner tire wall of the rear passenger side tandems are on the dashed line
    1. turn the wheel all the way to the right
        * watch passenger side tandems in your convex mirror until you feel they will roll through the channel
        * you can make an adjustment by straightening your steer tires and pulling forward
    1. turn the wheel all the way to the left
        * get under your trailer
    1. straighten wheels
        * outer tires on tandems should have passed *between* the cone and the single dash
        * ***DO NOT STOP UNTIL YOUR REAR TANDEM IS PAST THE DASH!!!*** not doing so will result in an automatic fail

## Reverse Offset Backing (basically Parallel to blind side)

* Setup
    1. pull forward until your trailer bumper is about in line with the end of the single dash
* Begin Maneuver
    1. 12 to 12 to the left
        * back up until you split center cone with bumper
    1. all the way
        * get under your trailer
        * check cone spacing in mirror
        * ***on this maneuver, there are no rear cones so you can only look for the 2 cones in your passenger mirror***
        * to make a correction, turn your wheels all the way towards the problem to create space, then turn wheels all the way to the other side to get under trailer. if done correctly, you should be properly spaced from the two cones
    1. straight back
        * inside tire wall of the rear driver side tandem should just touch the dashed line
    1. 12 to 12 to the right
        * watch tandems roll into the box with proper spacing
        * stop when landing gear is fully inside the box
    1. all the way
        * get under your trailer, you should be good
        * if you need to make a correction, use as much space as you have while remaining in the box
    1. straight line back
        * put your rear bumper in the box
        * use GOAL when just outside the box to judge your distance

## Notes

* when driving forward, drive the *truck*. when driving backward, drive the *trailer*
* *when putting the rear bumper in the box, use your trailer's marker light as a reference... remember to Get Out And Look... you do **not** want to put the bumper past the box!!*
