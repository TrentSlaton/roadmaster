<ol>
<li>make sure mirrors are properly adjusted to you (sides of trailer should be just visible on the edge of your mirrors)</li>
<li>drive truck straight forward so that it is centered in your lane. use your mirrors to judge this</li>
<li>with your steer axel and steering wheel straight, place your right hand at 12 o&rsquo;clock on the steering wheel and your left arm on the window sill</li>
<li>put the truck in reverse and take feet off both pedals. do not use your brake&hellip; just put your foot on the floor board</li>
<li>keep your eyes on your mirrors at all times. use the driver side mirror 90% of the time. just glance at the passenger side mirror if needed</li>
<li>either keep your wheel straight, or use the &ldquo;wiggle&rdquo; technique of alternating between 11 and 1 o&rsquo;clock on the steering wheel</li>
<li>when your trailer starts to drift, turn the wheel <em>no more than 9 to 3 o&rsquo;clock</em> <em><strong>towards</strong></em> the problem</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>when driving forward, drive the <em>truck</em>. when driving backward, drive the <em>trailer</em></li>
<li><em>when putting the rear bumper in the box, use your trailer&rsquo;s marker light as a reference&hellip; remember to Get Out And Look&hellip; you do <strong>not</strong> want to put the bumper past the box!!</em></li>

<li>turn the wheel 12 to 12 in the <em>opposite</em> direction that you want the trailer to go (if your trailer needs to left, turn to the right and vice versa)</li>
<li>use your convex mirror to split the center cone with the vertical part of the rear bumper</li>
<li>turn your wheel all the way the other way to get under your trailer</li>
<li>observe the two entry cones in your mirrors. you should be centered between them
<ul>
<li>to make an adjustment, turn your wheel all the way <em>towards</em> the problem to create some space, then turn your wheel all the way the other way to get under your trailer. if done properly, you should now be centered between the two entry cones</li>
